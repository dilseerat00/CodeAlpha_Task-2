## Project Overview
This repository contains two Python projects that help showcase Python programming skills for practical applications:
1. **Hangman Game** - A text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game.
2. **Student Grade Tracker** - A program to track student grades, view reports, and visualize student performance.

Both projects are designed to give hands-on experience with Python fundamentals, file handling, and data visualization.

## Task 1: Hangman Game

### Description
The **Hangman Game** is a text-based game where players must guess letters of a hidden word. The game starts by selecting a word randomly from a list, and players are prompted to guess a letter one at a time. If the guessed letter is correct, the word is partially revealed; if incorrect, a part of the hangman is drawn. The player continues until they guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.
